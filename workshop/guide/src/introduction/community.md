# Community
Today you are maybe exploring [Unison][unison] for the first time. If you are
lucky, you get to do that during a workshop. Getting to ask questions, and
sharing experiences is a way of making new friends and strengthening existing
bounds.

Even when you are working through this material on your own, there is stil a
place to find friendly people who are willing and able to discuss all things
Unison.

You can find that [community][discord] on Discord.

Don't hesitate to come by and say hi! You can find me there under the my
handle: `@dvberkel`.
