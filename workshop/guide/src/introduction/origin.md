# Origin
Let's talk about this workshop.

My first experiences with a computer where on a machine that had a
tape-recorder. When you invoked a magic incantation, the tape which contained
the game I want to play would whir and whine until the game could be started by
yet another arcane invocation.

While still young and walking through the local secondhand bookshop, I asked my
mother for a book about this mysterious machine: the commodore 64.

The book explained a little bit of the machine and its language. It was BASIC,
just like my understanding of the subject matter.
