# First Glance
We will take Unison for a spin, getting a taste for the difference and
resemblance between other development processes. This roughly follows along
with [unison at a glance][tutorial], with some bells and whistles.

You can find a transcript for this first glance in `examples/glance.u`.
In order to following along, you should have installed Unison. Take a look at
the installation appendix to learn how to install it.
